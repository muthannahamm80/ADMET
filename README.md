# ChEMBL Compound Dataset for hERG and CYP3A4

This script retrieves activity data from the ChEMBL database for the hERG and CYP3A4 targets, converts all potency measures to micromolar (Î¼M), removes salts and invalid SMILES, and filters to include only compounds with data for both targets. The dataset is limited to 300 compounds and saved as `dataset.csv`.
